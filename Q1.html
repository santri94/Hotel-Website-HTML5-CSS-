			Santi's Palace is a 5-star hotel in Riviera Maya with one of the best beachfront locations in the area, allowing guests a comfortable and unique way of enjoying the fine sand and clear waters. Only 10 minutes from Playa del Carmen and the Municipality of Solidaridad, 40 minutes from the airport, and near all of the most interesting and exciting attractions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Riviera Maya is famous for its large scale all-inclusive resorts and a historical tourism base of smaller boutique hotels as well as the many fine-dining restaurants available along the Fed 307 and on or near the beaches. Luxury travel entities have been instrumental in increasing luxury villa rentals and yacht charters in the area however these only represent a small fraction of the total tourism accommodation available.
			
			Santi's Palace offers you 674 rooms for your vacations in Riviera Maya, all of them outstanding for their elegant design, spaciousness and facilities for all the family. Some of them also have very convenient, direct access to the pool. For our most discerning guests we have Platinum rooms and Laguna Villa Suites. The Platinum rooms are located in an exclusive beachfront area and provide all of the facilities and amenities exclusive to the Platinum Zone. For larger families we have the Family Club Room Pool Access, ideal thanks to their exclusive services and spaciousness. The hotel also has several function rooms, making it perfect for hosting fun-packed family parties, celebrations or meetings.

		<p>
			Santi's Palace is renowned for its lush tropical gardens and especially for its Avenue of the Gods, the name given to the spectacular passage through the resort to the beach lined with statues of Mayan gods.

			Enjoy incredible evenings savoring the extensive choice of dining options with a great choice of buffets and 7 themed restaurants, ranging from the famous Mexican "Haciendas", passing through emblematic Switzerland to glittering Italy. Quality cuisine, with exquisite delicacies and unforgettable flavors. You have to try them!
